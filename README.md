# Snake-Water_Gun-Game

Snake Water Gun is one of the famous two-player games played by many children. It is very much similar to the Stone Paper Scissor game. 
It is a game in which the player randomly chooses any of the three forms i.e. snake(S), water(W), and gun(G). Here, we have implemented this game using the python random module, if-else statements, and playsound module to produce the sound of a win, lose, or tie.

This python project is to build a game for a single player that plays with the computer.

These are the rules need to be followed while playing this game.

1. In the case of Snake vs. Water, Snake drinks the water hence wins.
2. In the case of Water vs. Gun, The gun will drown in water, hence a point for water
3. In the case of Gun vs. Snake, Gun will kill the snake and win.

In situations where both parties choose the same object, the result will be a draw and each result will be also notified by a specific audio track.
